1  * Entrypoint in Docker?
	Similar to commands (CMD), where executable's are set when containers are initiated
	Unlinke CMD, entrypoint cannot be overridden 
2  * CMD vs Entrypoint ?
		CMD --> when we use multiple CMD's in a dockerfile, latest CMD instruction is applied
		     CMD can also be overridden when CMD is given at run time when initiating a container 
		Entrypoint --> When given in run time, entrypoint value is appended  
3  * ADD and Copy ?
	ADD --> Copy the file and also unzipping/extract a exiting tar/zipped file
		   If given a link, then it would download the file and copy it to the destination
	COPY --> It will only the copy the file to the destination 
4  * At the time of docker build –t cmd execution if you press CTRL+C, what happens ?
		It will stop the build process 
6  * Diff bw layers and image ?
		Each layer is an image itself 
 7  * If you give multiple entrypoints in Docker file, which will be executed and what happened to previous ones ?
		Latest entrypoint value is shown as output, previous entrypoint information is ignored
	
8  * By default in which user the container starts to execute cmds ?
		Root 
		To change it, we can provide the group and user information in the dockerfile, so containers run via this image will be run/owned by the user mentioned in the dockerfile
10 * what is container Runtime in Docker ?
		Docker engine is the container runtime, which creates and runs the contianers
12 * Write a Dockerfile and push to dockerhub.
		Example dockerfile
			FROM  OS
			RUN 
			CMD []
			ENTRYPOINT [] 
		• First we tag our docker image 
			docker tag image:tagname
		• Then we use docker push to push it to docker hub
			docker push  tagname 
13 * docker file structure
			FROM  OS
			RUN 
			CMD []
			ENTRYPOINT []
		
21 * difference between cmd and run
		RUN --> use to install packages and softwares in a image, so when a container is initialized the image will contain the packages and software which was used via 'RUN'
		CMD --> setting executables when containers are initiated 
23 * What are security measures you took to secure the docker image
		Scan for vulnerabilities on a docker image
		Place the docker image in a private repository
24 * Which scanning mechanism you are using,to scan the images regularly
		Docker scan
			(or)
		JFROG xray tool  
29 * How u create docker image from Dockerfile?
		Syntax:: Docker build -t imagename .   {-t  is for tagname for your image}
30 * Difference between docker image and container?
		Docker image is a read only template through which one can deploy/create docker contianers, docker images contain the required configuration to run the containers
		Docker container --> they are isolated userspace having minimal OS along with required applications 
32 * I have created a custom container , how can I deliver it to the other users?
		By pushing the custom container to dockerhub and providing the url to be used by other users
33 * Where u store docker images in project?
		Public (or) private repository on a dockerhub
35 * write the docker file with all the commands and explain
		FROM  ubuntu
		RUN  apt updates
		CMD ["echo", "ls -ltr]
		ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "ps -ef"]

51 * how will u scan ur docker images for security vulnerabilities?
		Using docker scan (or) Jfrog Xray tool 
63 * VM vs Docker
		VM is based hardware virtualization, it has it's own complete OS and dedicated resources (CPU/RAM/DIsk), Docker is OS virtualization, where underlying OS/Kernel is shared between the containers 
64 * Why cant we use AWS AMI instead of Docker Image
		AMI is like a vm template, which is using hardware virtualization, Docker is OS virtualization, where underlying OS/Kernel is shared between the containers
68 * If you give multiple entrypoints in Docker file, which will be executed and what happened to previous ones ?
		Latest entrypoint will be executed and the previous ones will be ignored
69 * By default in which user the container starts to execute cmds ?
		Root
78 * What's docker file
		Docker file is a text file, which contains all commands a user could/can call to build/assemble an image 
87 * In dockerfile run the application which command u use - entrypoint, CMd
		FROM  ubuntu
		RUN  apt updates
		CMD ["echo", "ls -ltr]
		ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "ps -ef"]
